# Neon Genesis: The Veil of Anon - Landing Page

Welcome to the repository for "Neon Genesis: The Veil of Anon", a project designed to showcase my proficiency in quickly developing engaging and responsive landing pages using modern web technologies, specifically **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. This project serves as a demonstration of my ability to craft visually appealing and functional user interfaces within a short timeframe, highlighting my skills in front-end development.

## Project Overview

This landing page is conceptualized around a futuristic, AI-driven theme, providing an immersive experience for visitors. It features:

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing, ensuring accessibility across devices.
- **Dynamic Interaction**: A simple state management system that changes the page content based on user interaction, demonstrating basic React state management.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizes Tailwind's utility-first CSS framework to rapidly style components, showcasing my proficiency in this modern CSS framework.
- **Next.js**: Leverages Next.js for server-side rendering, enhancing SEO and initial load performance.

## Features
